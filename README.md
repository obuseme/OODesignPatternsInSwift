OODesignPatternsInSwift
=======================
This project is meant to learn object oriented design patterns in the Swift programming language.  Specifically, the patterns from the book [Head First Design Patterns](http://www.amazon.com/Head-First-Design-Patterns-Freeman/dp/0596007124) will be implemented in the Swift programming language.  The unit tests will serve as the "client application" showing and testing usage of the pattern.

---------
You can find the Decorator pattern inside the Xcode group "Decorator."  Various guitar types are decorated with types of effects.
